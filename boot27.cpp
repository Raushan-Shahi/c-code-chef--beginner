/*
Words that contain many consecutive consonants, like "schtschurowskia", 
are generally considered somewhat hard to pronounce.
We say that a word is hard to pronounce if it contains 44 or more consonants in a row; 
otherwise it is easy to pronounce. For example, "apple" and "polish" are easy to pronounce,
 but "schtschurowskia" is hard to pronounce.
You are given a string SS consisting of NN lowercase Latin characters.
 Determine whether it is easy to pronounce or not based on the rule above â€” print YES
if it is easy to pronounce and NO otherwise.
For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are the characters
 \{a, e, i, o, u\}{a,e,i,o,u} and the consonants are the other 2121 characters.
